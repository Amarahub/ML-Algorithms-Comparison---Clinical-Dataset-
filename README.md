# ML-Algorithms-Comparison---Clinical-Dataset-

I recently carried out an extensive review of several ML algorithms and how the compared to each other in terms of performance, using eight different evaluation metrices (pls contact me for the full report). Six different datasets were used in this analysis; I have attached in this repository, the python codes used for the analysis as well as the datasets. The files are separated in six different folders.
